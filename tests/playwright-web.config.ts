/**
 * E2E config for the React WEB APP (web/standalone editor at :3048 + the
 * @pcbjam/backend-example reference backend at :3060), as opposed to the
 * merged playwright.config.ts which drives the standalone tool harness HTMLs
 * under tests/apps. Kept separate because this suite runs a different server
 * stack (`pnpm dev` two-server turbo), its own globalSetup health checks and a
 * fixed base URL.
 *
 * These tests exercise the real web open paths: navigate to /:scope/projects/:name/<file>,
 * let WasmTool boot the tool in-document (boot.ts), drive the project into MEMFS
 * and auto-open the file (open-flow.ts via Module.kicadOpenFile), and assert the
 * editor loaded wizard-free.
 *
 * The backend serves a single project off the local filesystem — no DB, no
 * seeding. The suite runs against the PRODUCTION stack: the standalone is
 * `vite build`-built and served by `vite preview` (build-preview.mjs — wasm
 * stays out of dist/, served same-origin at /wasm via the serveWasm plugin),
 * and the backend runs its no-watch `start` script. Locally an already-running
 * stack on the ports is reused as before (the common dev case); CI always
 * cold-starts both servers with the env below, pointing PROJECT_DIR at the
 * committed tests/fixtures/demo project (slug "demo").
 *
 * All projects use the BUNDLED browsers so the suite runs identically on CI
 * (no system-Chrome channel; ANGLE/Mesa-llvmpipe GL for GPU-less runners).
