## TL;DR (revised)
The `-O2` pass is **not** CPU-bound on optimization work. It is bound by a
**kernel page-management storm** on glibc Linux: the allocator constantly returns
freed pages to the OS (`madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`/`munmap`), and each return forces
**cross-core TLB-shootdown work** (plus, on Ubuntu 24.04, very likely
Transparent-Huge-Page compaction). That work is **system (kernel) time**, it
**scales super-linearly with thread count**, and it is **largely allocator-choice
independent** — which is exactly why swapping in *default* jemalloc only helped
~15%. The real levers (all **untested** before this doc, all now wired into a
bench harness) are: **(1) configure the allocator to never purge**, **(2) disable
THP**, **(3) use fewer threads**. Primary-source precedent on this exact workload
class shows the win is **multiplicative (2×–15×), not marginal**.

## The measurements that settle it
Per-pass `/usr/bin/time -v`, pulled from the real CI runs
(`emergence-engineering/pcbjam`, workflow "CI"). The earlier table omitted the
**context-switch and page-fault counters — those are the diagnostic gold.**

### `wasm-opt -O2` pass (the ~80-min bottleneck)
| metric | 8c glibc (run 27139529490) | 32c glibc (27144910231) | 32c jemalloc-default (27186569662) |
|---|---|---|---|
| BINARYEN_CORES | 8 | 32 | 32 |
| wall clock | **1:23:57** (5037 s) | **1:28:30** (5310 s) | 1:16:23 (4583 s) |
| user time | 12,807 s | 13,043 s | 12,177 s |
| **system time** | **18,030 s (58%)** | **114,075 s (90%)** | **95,525 s (89%)** |
| % CPU | 612% | 2393% | 2349% |
| peak RSS | 39.8 GB | 39.7 GB | 39.0 GB |
| minor page faults | 73.7 M | 67.2 M | 69.7 M |
| **voluntary ctx-switches** | **674,829,131** | **180,672,277** | **149,367,474** |
| involuntary ctx-switches | 31,675 | 1,235,328 | 1,429,770 |

### `--asyncify` pass (same machine, only ~6 GB RSS — shows the storm too)
| metric | 8c glibc | 32c glibc | 32c jemalloc-default |
|---|---|---|---|
| wall | 9:26 (566 s) | **10:51 (651 s)** | 8:28 (508 s) |
| user / system | 1,317 / 2,715 s | 1,187 / **19,045 s** | 994 / 14,630 s |
| voluntary ctx-switches | 61.8 M | 10.4 M | 7.3 M |

### What these numbers prove
1. **Cores anti-scale.** Under the *same* allocator, 32c is *slower* than 8c
   (-O2: 5310 vs 5037 s; asyncify: 651 vs 566 s). System time scales **~6.3×
   for a 4× core bump** (18k→114k) while user time stays flat. That super-linear-
   in-cores, flat-in-user-work shape is the fingerprint of **cross-core kernel
   coordination (TLB shootdowns / compaction)**, not of the optimization work.
2. **Only ~2.5 cores of real work ever happen.** user ÷ wall ≈ 12,800 ÷ 5,000 ≈
   **2.5** at both 8c and 32c. `wasm-opt -O2` barely parallelizes on this module
   (a few asyncify-created monster functions dominate — Amdahl). The other ~20
   "busy" cores at 32c are burning **kernel** time, not optimizing.
3. **The contention is allocator-independent.** glibc and jemalloc both sit at
   **150–680 M voluntary context-switches** and ~70 M page faults; jemalloc-
   default shaved only ~16% of system time and ~14% of wall. A real arena-lock
   problem would have collapsed under jemalloc. It didn't → the cost is **not**
   in the allocator's arenas.
4. **The ctx-switch *inversion* (8c=675 M vs 32c=181 M, yet 32c has 6× the system
   time)** means at 32c threads stop *sleeping* on locks and instead *spin in the
   kernel* (TLB-shootdown IPIs / page-table locks) — consistent with the
   shootdown model, not userspace mutex spinning (which would be *user* time).

## Root cause
**A kernel virtual-memory storm driven by allocator page-return traffic.** Both
glibc and (default) jemalloc periodically hand freed pages back to the OS via
`madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`/`munmap`. On x86-64 each such return triggers a
**TLB shootdown** — the OS sends IPIs to the other cores running the process's
threads to flush their TLBs — which costs more the more cores exist (hence the
6.3× system-time blow-up 8c→32c). On Ubuntu 24.04 with THP active, faulting
threads can additionally stall in **direct compaction** (`__alloc_pages_slowpath`
→ `try_to_compact_pages`) plus background `khugepaged`. macOS doesn't hit this
(different VM/TLB + allocator, bare-metal, only 10 cores), which is why the
weaker Mac is faster. **Which term dominates — shootdowns vs compaction — was not
yet measured on this exact module; Phase 0 of the experiment plan measures it.**

## Deep-research corroboration (primary sources)
A fan-out research pass (Linux kernel THP docs, jemalloc/mimalloc tuning docs,
glibc-maintainer write-up, Binaryen issues) independently reached the same
diagnosis and supplied the key precedent:
- **Binaryen #5561** — 48-core AMD EPYC, 128 GB, Ubuntu: `wasm-opt` went
  **58m35s → 3m43s** (system time 2,395 min → 40 s) just by switching the
  allocator to **mimalloc** (which by default purges far less aggressively).
  Same anti-scaling signature as ours. This is the upside ceiling.
- **Binaryen #6338** — a 10× `wasm-opt` slowdown "fixed by using Emscripten's
  mimalloc port." Multiplicative, not marginal.
- jemalloc `TUNING.md`: decay time is "a trade-off between CPU and memory" — the
  default *keeps* issuing `madvise`, which is precisely why a default jemalloc
  swap didn't help. The fix is to **disable decay** (retain memory).
- Live alternative hypothesis (do not ignore): Binaryen's own `wasm::Type` global
  mutex (mutrace: 41.8 M locks / 10.7 M contentions in #5561) can contribute
  futex/system time **independent of malloc** — unfixed by any allocator/THP
  change. If allocator-retain + THP-off underperform, this is the next suspect,
  and it points at **upgrading Binaryen** (see below).

### Corrections from adversarial verification (don't repeat these overclaims)
- ❌ "MADV_DONTNEED broadcasts IPIs to *all* CPUs and is KVM-amplified" — refuted.
  Shootdowns go only to cores that ran the process's threads; no special VM
  penalty was substantiated. (Still scales with thread count.)
- ❌ "`dirty_decay_ms:-1` is the documented official fix and fully stops madvise"
  — failed verification; one report saw madvise persist anyway. **Every retain
  config must be strace/perf-verified to confirm madvise actually drops to ~0.**
- ❌ "THP high-system-time symptom definitely matches ours" — the *mechanism* is
  well-documented but attribution to THP for *this* module is an inference;
  measure it (Phase 0), don't assume.

## Levers, ranked (exact flags)
All are env/sysctl only (no pipeline change) except D/E. 128 GB RAM vs ~40 GB
peak makes "never return memory" safe.

| # | Lever | Exact change | Confidence | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Fewer threads | `BINARYEN_CORES=8` (sweep 4–16) | High — *already in our data* (8c ties/beats 32c) | none |
| **B** | Allocator retain (KILLS the purge) | jemalloc `MALLOC_CONF=dirty_decay_ms:-1,muzzy_decay_ms:-1,background_thread:true` · mimalloc `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY=-1` · glibc `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_=-1 MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_=0` | High mechanism; **must verify madvise→0** | low (more RAM) |
| **C** | Disable THP | `echo never | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/{enabled,defrag}` | High mechanism | low |
| **B+C** | Stack | retain allocator + THP=never | High | low |
| **D** | Newer Binaryen / bundled mimalloc | bump `BINARYEN_VERSION` past 121 (`scripts/common/get-wasm-opt.sh`) | Med (#5561/#6338) | **Med-High**: must match the emsdk Binaryen or asyncify metadata corrupts ("func is not a function"); needs e2e |
| **E** | Shrink the `-O2` input | bigger `asyncify-removelist` / `-O1`/targeted passes vs full `-O2` | Med | Med — needs Chrome e2e per change |
| — | Contention-only controls (expected to NOT fix it) | `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=4`, `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DECOMMITS=0` | — | — |

**Lever / merely-reduces-contention distinction:** retain configs (B) *kill* the
madvise/munmap traffic; `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX` only trims arena-lock cost (which
isn't our bottleneck) — included as a control to confirm the diagnosis.

## Expected outcome / the 30-min question
At 8c, if `-O2` parallelized perfectly with zero system time it'd be ~27 min
(12,807 s ÷ 8 ÷ 60). The gap to 84 min is the storm **plus** parallelism capped
at ~2.5× — and 32c tying 8c implies **contention is what caps the parallelism**.
So killing the storm should cut system time *and* unlock real core scaling →
**~30 min is plausible** but bounded by Binaryen's true serial fraction (unknown
until measured). Going clearly below likely also needs Lever D and/or E. The
#5561 15.8× is a ceiling demonstration, not a prediction (our *user* time is real).

## The experiment plan (single Hetzner slot at a time)
Running one full CI per config is wasteful (re-compile + e2e). Instead a
dedicated bench builds the `-O2` **input once**, caches it as an artifact, and
replays the sweep over it — many data points per slot, later runs skip the build.

- **Phase 0 (in run #1):** run `baseline` with `DIAGNOSTIC=1` to attribute the
  kernel time. Decision rule:
  - `native_flush_tlb_multi` / `smp_call_function_many` high + `madvise` flood →
    **Lever B** (allocator retain).
  - `try_to_compact_pages` / `compaction_*` / `__alloc_pages_slowpath` + rising
    `/proc/vmstat:compact_stall` → **Lever C** (THP=never).
  - `wasm::Type::*` / futex with **no** madvise flood → **Lever D** (Binaryen ver).
- **Phase 1:** sweep B / C / B+C over the cached fixture; confirm each drops
  voluntary ctx-switches and `madvise` count by 10–100×.
- **Phase 2:** validate the winner end-to-end (full build + Chrome e2e) — `-O2`
  exists to keep asyncify functions under V8's locals limit, so a faster config
  that corrupts the module is worthless.

## The bench harness (how the next agent runs it)
Added in this branch:
- **`.github/workflows/wasm-opt-bench.yml`** — ephemeral Hetzner ccx53, builds-or-
  downloads the fixture, runs the sweep, uploads `o2-bench-results-<run_id>`.
  Triggers on **push to `bench/**`** (can't collide with main CI `[main]` or the
  feature-branch Hetzner CI). `concurrency: wasm-opt-bench` (one VM at a time).
- **`scripts/bench/o2-config-sweep.sh`** — replays `wasm-opt -O2` over the fixture
  under each preset; records `time -v` counters + a perf-stat `madvise/munmap`
  count; `DIAGNOSTIC=1` adds vmstat/interrupts deltas + a perf kernel-symbol
  sample. Preset menu is in the script's `config_env`.
- **`scripts/bench/sweep.conf`** — committed run parameters (CONFIGS / CORES /
  FIXTURE_RUN_ID / DIAGNOSTIC). Edit + commit + push to `bench/**` to launch.

**Drive it:**
1. Run #1 (this branch): `CONFIGS_CONF="baseline mimalloc-retain"`,
   `FIXTURE_RUN_ID_CONF=""` (builds + caches fixture), `DIAGNOSTIC_CONF=1`.
2. Note run #1's id → set `FIXTURE_RUN_ID_CONF` to it so later runs skip the
   ~40-min build, then sweep `"thp-off jemalloc-retain glibc-retain
   thp-off+mimalloc-retain"`.
3. Core sweep the winner: `CONFIGS="<winner>"`, `CORES_CONF=8` (then 16, 4).

Pull results: `gh run download <run_id> -n o2-bench-results-<run_id>`, read
`results.csv` (the `vol_ctxsw`, `sys_s`, and `madvise` columns tell the story).

## Why local QEMU is NOT a fair proxy (asked & answered)
The existing `scripts/bench/` QEMU harness can only run the *asyncify* pass
locally — three independent blockers for `-O2`: (1) **RAM** — `-O2` needs ~40 GB,
a 32 GB Mac caps a guest at ~20 GB → OOM; (2) **arch** — the storm is x86 IPI
TLB-shootdowns, but Apple Silicon is aarch64 with hardware-broadcast `TLBI`
(different mechanism/scaling); (3) **core count** — can't reach the 32-core regime
where it's worst. Use QEMU only for the free "does this config stop madvise"
smoke test on the asyncify pass; do the real numbers on the disposable ccx53.

## Branch / repo state at handoff
- Bench work on branch **`bench/wasm-opt-allocator-sweep`** (off
  `istvanmatejcsok/feat/ci-hetzner-allcores`). Adds the three files above.
- CI uses **standalone Binaryen v121** (`get-wasm-opt.sh` fallback; CI has no
  local emsdk). Lever D must keep this in sync with the emsdk Binaryen.
- Repo `emergence-engineering/pcbjam`. Main CI runs on **Ubicloud** (`[main]`);
  the Hetzner ccx53 only spins for the two `ci-hetzner` feature branches and the
  new `bench/**` branch. "One Hetzner slot at a time" is the operative limit.
- `apply-asyncify.sh`: jemalloc auto-preload + `ASYNCIFY_ONLY=1` (stops before
  -O2 — used to build the bench fixture) + `WASM_OPT_PRELOAD=none` sentinel.

## Useful commands
- Pull per-pass timing from a finished CI run's live log:
  `gh run view <id> --repo emergence-engineering/pcbjam --log | grep -iE "Running wasm-opt|User time|System time|Elapsed \(wall|Maximum resident|context switches|page faults"`
- Older runs (no live log): `gh run download <id> -n e2e-logs` → `logs/build/*.log`.
- Launch a bench run: edit `scripts/bench/sweep.conf`, commit, `git push` to the
  `bench/**` branch.
